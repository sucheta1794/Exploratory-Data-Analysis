# Exploratory Data Analysis with pandas profiling
EDA and pandas profiling to understand your data before machine learning

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for developing effective machine learning models.
- EDA brings out understanding your data in detail.
- You understand each variable individually by calculating frequency counts, visualizing the distributions, etc.
- Also the relationships between the various combinations of the predictor and response variables by creating scatterplots, correlations, etc.
- EDA is typically part of every machine learning / predictive modeling project, especially with tabular datasets.
- Pandas profiling is a very powerful tool that enables user to get a complete report on the EDA of your data

## Why EDA?
* Understand the variables that could be important in predicting the target variable.
* Generate insights that give us more understanding of the context and performance of the problem under study.
