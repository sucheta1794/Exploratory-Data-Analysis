# Exploratory Data Analysis with pandas profiling
EDA and pandas profiling to understand your data before machine learning

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for developing effective machine learning models.
- EDA brings out understanding your data in detail.
- You understand each variable individually by calculating frequency counts, visualizing the distributions, etc.
- Also the relationships between the various combinations of the predictor and response variables by creating scatterplots, correlations, etc.
- EDA is typically part of every machine learning / predictive modeling project, especially with tabular datasets.

## Why EDA?
* Understand which variables could be important in predicting the Y (response).
* Generate insights that give us more understanding of the business context and performance
